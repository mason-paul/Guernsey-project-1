    <h3>What to do in Guernsey</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <p>Guernsey has the most beautiful beaches to swim in, each year charity work created the event 30 bays in 30 days, this encorages people to raise money for chairity by swimming all 30 beaches/bays. The locals swim all year round in all weathers this has been a film based around this called "Sea Donkey" which I would highly recommend watching.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Tours</li>
        <p>When in Guernsey you must go on one of our local tours of the island either by tuc tuc or the safiri tour. These will allow you to see the beautiful island and the history of the island.</p>
