# Welcome to my firt website project one-Guernsey!

This is my first project with the code institute which I have been working on for two months. I had taken a four months off before coming back to finish my project.

## Introduction:

This website is for users to explore and have some understanding of my home Guernsey. It will inform users that are looking to explore the channel islands what one of the islands are like Guernsey, the Island on which I live.


### Steps taken to produce Guernsey website.

#### The first step is design:

When designing this project I used the free (suggested) Balsamic app to get a basic layout of the site. The deign had changed multiple times. I wanted a user friendly, simplistic website that would allow a user to interact with.

The website would have been too overly designed if a Guernsey photo was used as a back ground. but still wanted the user to see the beauty of the Island so each page had at least one photo of Guernsey.

##### The Index page.

The index page was firstly designed with a photo with that local town with the unique buses
