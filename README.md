# Welcome to my firt website project one-Guernsey!

This is my first project with the [Code Insitute](https://codeinstitute.net) which I have been working on for two months. I had taken a four months off before coming back to finish my project.

## Introduction:

This website is for users to explore and have some understanding of my home Guernsey. It will inform users that are looking to explore the channel islands what one of the islands are like Guernsey, the Island on which I live. All photos/images used in this website are free stock photos used from unsplash and pexels recommended by code institute.


### Steps taken to produce Guernsey website.

#### The first step is design:

When designing this project I used the free (suggested) Balsamic app to get a basic layout of the site. The deign had changed multiple times. I wanted a user friendly, simplistic website that would allow a user to interact with.

The website would have been too overly designed if a Guernsey photo was used as a back ground. but still wanted the user to see the beauty of the Island so each page had at least one photo of Guernsey.

Each page layout should be the same as such I wanted to have the social networking at the bottom of each page.

##### The Index page.

The index page was firstly designed with a photo with that local town with the unique buses with historical information about Guernsey with the Google maps at the bottom to allow users to know exactly  where the Island is.



##### The Activities page.

This page is to inform users of what the Island has to offer in terms of activities. These activities

### What needs to improve (should have done differently):

Comments- within my code I should have used more comments throughout my project highlighting more about where I got information and what I plan to do.

README.md- this file i had started at the end of my project and should have started it when i started my project. I found using then readme at the end made my project more complicated to complete when trying to show my designs as I am unable to find them now and unable to show them.

Time management- over the course of this project I should have created a timeliness allowing for how much time should of been on each section of the website. This then allowed for the design of the website, HTML, CSS, readme file,validation and trial of the site.

CSS code- this section of the website is online ?% of the overall website which could have been a little more with detailing more of the sign up form.


### What went well:

Fun- this project has allowed me to explore coding in a very fun way allowing me to explore different
